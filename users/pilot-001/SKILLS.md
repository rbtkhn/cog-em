## I. CONTAINER STATUS

### READ Container

```yaml
status: SEED (parent-reported, Tier 5)
letters: yes (all 26)
reads_words: yes
reads_sentences: yes
reads_pages: yes
sounds_out_unfamiliar: yes
retells_stories: yes
vocabulary_level: 2      # estimated, pending WRITE samples
comprehension_level: 2-3  # retells with main events, characters, plot
inference_level: null     # not yet assessed
edge: "Longer independent text; early chapter books; inference questions"
gaps: []
notes: "Strong reader for first grade. Collaborative reading preferred (Phase 2) despite independent capability."
```

### WRITE Container

```yaml
status: SEED (parent-reported, Tier 5)
writes_name: yes
writes_words: yes
writes_sentences: yes
phonetic_spelling: uncertain  # EDGE
vocabulary_level: 2      # estimated, pending samples
complexity_level: 2      # writes sentences; longer compositions not confirmed
style_level: null        # needs actual writing samples
expression_level: null   # needs actual writing samples
logic_level: null        # needs actual writing samples
edge: "Phonetic/invented spelling; writing beyond single sentences; connectors (because, so, then)"
gaps: []
notes: "Can produce sentences independently. Phonetic encoding uncertain — key edge to test."
```

### IMAGINE Container

```yaml
status: SEED (from Phase 2 survey)
originality_level: null   # needs activity evidence
reasoning_level: 2        # multi-step instructions, sequential thinking (forward + backward)
flexibility_level: null   # not yet assessed
elaboration_level: null   # not yet assessed
edge: "Pattern recognition; cause-effect reasoning; creative narrative production"
gaps: []
notes: "Draws animals/nature (Phase 2). Imagines talking animal worlds. Lego style is methodical/structured."
```

### MATH (contextual — not a pillar, but tracked)

```yaml
status: SEED (parent-reported, Tier 5)
counts_to: 100
addition: yes (single digit)
subtraction: yes (single digit)
tells_time: no           # EDGE
days_of_week: yes (forward AND backward)
edge: "Telling time; place value; double-digit operations"
notes: "Days of week backward is a strong sequential reasoning signal."
```

### CHINESE (contextual)

```yaml
status: SEED (parent-reported, Tier 5)
oral_conversational: yes  # daily home use, full back-and-forth
counts_in_chinese: yes    # at least to 10
character_recognition: no # EDGE — literacy not started
character_writing: no
edge: "First character recognition; expanding vocabulary beyond home context"
notes: "Strong oral. Literacy is a clear future growth area."
```

### SCHOOL

```yaml
grade: first grade
school_type: not specified
