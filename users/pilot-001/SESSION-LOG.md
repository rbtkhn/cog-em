participants: parent + child (child answered Qs)
method: artwork upload + multiple choice Q&A via Cursor chat
activity_type: creation analysis + child interview
evidence_tier: 4  # OBSERVED (actual artifact + child commentary)
```

**Artwork:** Nine-Colored Deer (九色鹿)
**Image:** artifacts/CREATE-0001-nine-colored-deer.png
**Source:** Chinese folk tale, text-only book — "a word book, not a picture book, so we have to imagine it ourselves"

**Child Q&A:**

| Q | Question | Answer |
|---|----------|--------|
| 1 | What is this animal? | A — a deer |
| 2 | Why the rainbow? | Off-script: "It's a rainbow scarf, not a rainbow tail" |
| 3 | What are the hearts? | Off-script: explained the whole source story (Nine-Colored Deer, Chinese text-only book) |
| 4 | Story in Chinese or English? | A — Chinese |
| 5 | What is the deer doing? | A — standing on top of the mountain, being strong and proud |
| 6 | The circle behind its head? | B — a halo, the deer is special |
| 7 | Why did you pick this story? | B — wanted to draw something from a Chinese story |
| 8 | Why do you like the deer? | All of the above — beautiful, kind, AND brave |

**Key findings:**
- First Tier 4 (OBSERVED) evidence in the profile
- Chinese cultural identity is ACTIVE — deliberately chose Chinese folklore
- Cross-language comprehension → creation pipeline: Chinese text → visual art
- "All of the above" pattern confirmed (also appeared Phase 2 Q8)
- Understood story meaning — knew the halo represents sacredness, hearts represent kindness
- Corrected the observer confidently ("it's a scarf, not a tail")

**Updates made:**
- EVIDENCE.md — Creation Log entry CREATE-0001
- SKILLS.md — IMAGINE container activated (originality 4, elaboration 4)
- SELF.md — Values seeded (kindness, bravery, beauty), cultural identity note, narrative updated

**Phase 4 continued — additional artwork:**

| # | Title | Type | Context | Key Signal |
|---|-------|------|---------|------------|
| CREATE-0005 | Tomb of Pakal | Collage | School | Ancient Maya — knows Pakal by name |
| CREATE-0006 | Abby on the Moon | Drawing (black paper) | School | Self as astronaut, planted her own flag |
| CREATE-0007 | Egyptian Pharaohs | Drawing | School | Ancient Egypt — school covers Maya + Egypt |
| CREATE-0008 | Snowman | Collage (black paper) | School | Striped scarf+hat (her choice), eyelashes, caregiving |

**Additional note captured:** Abby loves Van Gogh's "Starry Night" (parent-reported).

**Clarification:** Grace-Mar = cognitive twin name. Abby = the real 6-year-old child.

**Phase 4 Summary — 8 artworks analyzed:**
